## ðŸŽ¯ **Most Critical Missing Features**

### 1. **Multi-line Log Support**
Many logs have stack traces or multi-line events that we currently miss.

### 2. **Temporal Pattern Analysis**
We don't analyze how patterns change over time or detect degradation.

### 3. **Subsystem Correlation**
We don't identify how failures in one system affect others.

### 4. **Confidence Scoring**
Users don't know how certain our categorizations are.

### 5. **Historical Learning**
We don't learn from previous analyses to improve accuracy.

### 6. **Real-time Alerting**
No way to get immediate notifications for critical issues.
